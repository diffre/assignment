Assessment Task
Devise project schedule and cost management plans that articulate the schedule and cost approaches
for a project using the assigned project case study provided by your Learning Facilitator.

Context
The backbone of a project manager’s work is the Project Management Plan. This plan is the document
that describes how the project will be executed, monitored and controlled. It integrates and
consolidates all of the subsidiary plans and baselines from the planning processes. In this assessment,
you will create subsidiary cost and schedule components of a Project Management Plan for your
assigned Case Study.
Project Schedule Management includes all the processes of planning, estimating, sequencing,
managing, and controlling the schedule for a timely completion of the project.
